git Unable to create
fatal: Unable to create 'e:/git/Android/XXXXXX/.git/index.lock': File e
xists.

If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
process is running and remove the file manually to continue.

 

解决办法：找到index.lock 删除即可
